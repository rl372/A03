Basics of GIT/Github
GIT is a open source version control system. A brief overview on how GIT works is you first create a repository on a git hosting tool or site, like github. This repository will be a remote repository used to hold files and folders for a project. There are two types of repositories, local and remote. Local repositories are ones that you currently have on your local system, e.g., on your computer, while remote repositories are stored on the internet, on a say a git hosting site like github. You can clone this repository to add it to another folder for later. Inside this repository will be a main file. 

The next step would be to create a branch off main to use as a space to make edits and experimenting before committing them to the actual code. You can create as many branches as you’d like and they all act as basically a copy of the main file. 
Inside the branches, make some changes to anything and when you fully finish making edits save them and make a commit. These changes would now be visible when you open the branch that you made the commit on. 

On github, the changes you request would be shown as green or red from then original branch. The final step to this would be to merge the changes you proposed into that branch. Once everything is sorted, you would click the merge pull request and finish the pull request.
In GIT, fetch only finds and downloads new data and commits from a file or repository that has changed. It does not do anything with it so the files you are currently working on wouldn’t be touched. You can also use the Push command, which works kind of the opposite way of the fetch command. Push allows you to export commits to another repository, whereas fetch imports commits from another repository. Pull on the other hand like with the pull requests, will add in whatever changes you implemented in another branch to the one you are currently on, merging them. This can sometimes cause a merge conflict and prevent the merge from happening. This can be caused by many issues, but typically can happen when multiple people try to work on a same branch.

Glossary:

•	Branch- A branch is a separate copy of a main file in a repository where changes can be made as necessary without making changes to the main file.

•	Clone – A command to make a copy of a repository and add it to another folder

•	Commit – A commit is when you save edits made in a branch and add them to the main file.

•	Fetch – Fetch is a command that finds and downloads new data and commits from a changed file or repository.

•	GIT – GIT is a open source version control system, used to handle projects of varying sizes with great efficiency.

•	Github – Github is a cloud based site for storing repositories online and allows user to access and edit remote repositories.

•	Merge – Merge is when you add in commits made in one branch to another branch.

•	Merge Conflict – An error that occurs when a merge is unsuccessful or causes issues.

•	Push – Push is a command that exports commits into another repository.

•	Pull – Pull is a command that adds changes made in another branch into the one you are currently working on.

•	Remote – Remote refers to repositories that are stored on the internet, like on github.

•	Repository – A repository is a folder or a directory where you can store files on.
